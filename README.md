# quiz-game-time

## Description

The goal is the following:

**
User Story
- AS A coding boot camp student
- I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores  
- SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

Acceptance Criteria
- GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
- WHEN I click the start button
- THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
- WHEN I answer a question
- THEN I am presented with another question
- WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
- THEN time is subtracted from the clock
- WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
- THEN the game is over
- WHEN the game is over
- THEN I can save my initials and my score**

While I have met the requirements for this project, I believe that there is still room for optimization in certain areas ie:

- need to add addtional properties to the input bar so it includes the placeholder and the user doesn't have to wonder what to type in, adding it after the naming its id was not fruitful

- need to add a functional 'play again button' so the user does not have to disconnect from play mode and refresh the page themselves. In addition to that, the CSS of it would need to appear below the input box & submit button, with a top margin so it's not glued to one another.

- highscore section bug: only displays the initials and score if you submit it twice. also in most games high scores are listed in descending order, so the user does not have look for their highest score, it currrently looks likes word vomit and displays the scores in the order in which they were earned. so it needs an additional functino to monitor that

- the question font-size is too small

The images below will disaply what the quiz looks like:
